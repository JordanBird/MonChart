# MonChart
Welcome to MonChart! A tool to create charts and collections of Pokémon.

Looking to track your collection, shiny hunt or generate a chart that shows a certain type of Pokémon? MonChart can help!

Usage is pretty simple, click, or click and then drag on the Pokémon you want to select, the initial colour you select will be the colour that's applied.

Once you've selected all the Pokémon you want to, right click the graph and select 'Save Image'. If you want to save what you've entered on MonChart the URL will remember your selections so you can continue to update that and resaving (or share the URL).

MonChart is hosted on GitHub pages and is available [here.](http://jordanbird.github.io/MonChart)
